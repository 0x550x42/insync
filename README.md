# inSync - Contacts Exchange System

Contacts exchange system with a different approach. The purpose of creating this system was to do away with the hassle of exchanging contact numbers with people when you switch to a new number or start using a new number.

This system aims to keep your phonebook and your sim numbers synchronised with those you want and how you want. Then, If you know you are using say contact number ``` xyz ``` and you tell the application that this is the number I intend to use now.

The app will sync in up on to all people's devices which were connected wo you and the next time they wish to call you up. They will already have your number sitting in their phonebook under your contact name.
